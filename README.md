## About

I work on content and communications systems for teams operating at scale, 
particularly in regulated and high-trust environments.

My focus is not content volume, but decision clarity, governance, and durability.

## What I publish here

This space is used to share:

- Content system blueprints
- Editorial governance frameworks
- Operating principles for content and communications leaders

This repository is intentionally quiet and curated.

## How I work

- Long-term retainers
- Advisory and systems design
- Small number of active partnerships
